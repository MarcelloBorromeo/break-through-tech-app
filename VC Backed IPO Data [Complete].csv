limitations of currently approved therapies and patient reluctance to undergo radical cystectomy, or the
complete removal of the bladder. We are evaluating the safety and efficacy of cretostimogene as monotherapy
in BOND-003, our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in high-risk BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients. We have
completed enrollment for this trial, reported interim data in November 2023 and expect to report topline data by
the end of 2024. If successful, we believe that this trial could serve as the basis for a Biologics License

cretostimogene when administered to this same patient population in combination with FDA-approved

promotions to over 200 million consumers through a single, convenient network called the Ibotta Performance

results in a sale, not when a consumer merely views or clicks on the promotion. We have built the largest digital
item-level promotions network in the United States by forming strategic relationships with major retailers which
use our digital offers to power their loyalty programs on a white-label basis. Through the IPN, our clients can
also reach millions more consumers on our widely used rewards app digital properties, which include the Ibottabranded cash back mobile app, website, and browser extension (collectively, Ibotta D2C). We work directly with
over 850 different clients, representing over 2,400 different CPG brands to source exclusive offers as of
